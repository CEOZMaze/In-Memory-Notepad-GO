<p>In your edition, it is customary to put the first paragraph in the preview of the article. But the text comes to you in the program as a whole. In order to optimize the process and not copy this paragraph manually every time, you decided to write a small program that takes all the text from standard input (<code class="java">stdin</code>) and displays only one paragraph.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Please note that each paragraph of text in the electronic representation is a separate line. So one must remember the stream input function, which allows you to scan with the newline character <code class="java">\n</code> as a delimiter.</div>

Often, more information is available within the error. For example, if a call that takes a file name fails, such as Open or Stat, the error will include the failing file name when printed and will be of type *PathError, which may be unpacked for more information.<br>The os interface is intended to be uniform across all operating systems. Features not generally available appear in the system-specific package syscall.<br>Here is a simple example, opening a file and reading some of it. </code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Package os provides a platform-independent interface to operating system functionality.</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
